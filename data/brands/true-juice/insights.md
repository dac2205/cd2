### Insight 1: "Fear of Collapse > Desire for Health"
This audience isn't looking for "wellness" or "beauty" effectively; they are looking for *survival* and *insurance* against work-induced collapse. They have money but no time, so they buy "health assurance."

### Insight 2: "Medical Fatigue"
They are tired of the clinical approach (doctors, pills) which feels like "sickness management." They want "health creation" that feels natural but structured (hence "Liệu trình" not just "Juice").

### Insight 3: "The Trust Deficit"
In a market flooded with "healthy" products, their biggest barrier is doubt. "Is this just sugar water?" Relying on the *Practitioner* (Huyền) gives permission to trust the product as a therapy, not a treat.

### Brand Inconsistency
Current issue: "Không biết. Nhiều. Loạn". The brand message is cluttered. It needs to strip back to the core promise: **Natural Therapy for the Busy Leader**.
