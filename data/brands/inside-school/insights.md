### Insight 1: "It's not about the features, it's about the feelings."
Most creators list what they *know*, but audiences buy how they want to *feel*. 
*Example*: Don't sell "content calendar templates"; sell "the relief of knowing exactly what to post for the next month".

### Insight 2: "Consistency > Intensity"
The algorithm rewards showing up, but human beings reward *reliability*. It is better to post 3 times a week for a year than 7 times a week for a month and then quit.

### Insight 3: "Your struggle is your content."
The things you find hard are often the most relatable content pillars. Sharing the process of overcoming a struggle builds more trust than sharing the perfect result.
